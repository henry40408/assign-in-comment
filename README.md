> directly assign members in issue or pull request description

## Setup

```bash
$ npm install # Install dependencies
$ npm start # Run the bot
```

See [docs/deploy.md](docs/deploy.md) if you would like to run your own instance of this app.

## How to Use

1. Open a new pull request or edit an existing pull request.
2. Type `/assign @user1 @user2`, **do not prepend or append anything to the line**.
3. Submit or save the pull request.
4. `user1` and `user2` would be assigned to the pull request after a while.

The procedure also works for the issues.
